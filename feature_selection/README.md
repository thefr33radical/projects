# Feature Selection Techniques

### selecting the best features wither by elimination or scaling, they are implemented here.Ranking the importance of features is also done.

### Recursive Feature Selection
Input : pandas dataframe [ X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test ]
Output : pandas dataframe [ X_test ]

### PCA : PCA generates new featuresin n dimension, not subset of features.
Input : pandas dataframe [ X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test ]
Output : pandas dataframe [ X_test ]

### LDA : Linear Discriminant analysis


### Feature Ranking
#### Rank based on RFE method
Input : pandas dataframe [ X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test ]
Output : pandas dataframe [ Feature Rank in CSV ]
