DeepSequence
DeepSequence is a generative, unsupervised latent variable model for biological sequences. Given a multiple sequence alignment as an input, it can be used to predict accessible mutations, extract quantitative features for supervised learning, and generate libraries of new sequences satisfying apparent constraints. It models higher-order dependencies in sequences as a nonlinear combination of constraints between subsets of residue.
