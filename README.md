# projects

## Author : Thefr33radical

### Individual project implementations across various domain.
### Each Project comes with own requirements.txt and README.MD for further info.
### The main goal is to make the each projects independent and easy to deploy/understand. Efficiency is ignored for the same reason. Almost all projects are almost unoptimized, the intention is to use them as templates and build on them rather than the final build.
