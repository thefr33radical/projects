How does your class exercisecompare with Rosie Ma™am™sclass exercise?Rosie Ma™am™s class has 30 children. She did thesame exercise in her class and here is the result.  57Breaking stereotypesBreaking stereotypesBreaking stereotypesBreaking stereotypesBreaking stereotypesEngine drivers are men. But 27-year-old Laxmi Lakra, from a
poor tribal family in Jharkhand has begun to change things.
She is the first woman engine driver for Northern Railways.
Laxmi™s parents are not literate but they struggled and
overcame many hardships to make sure their children got an
education. Laxmi studied in a government school. Even in school,
Laxmi helped with the housework and did odd jobs. She studied
hard and did well and then went on to get a diploma in
electronics. She then took the railway board exam and passed
it on her first attempt.
Laxmi says, ﬁI love challenges and the moment somebody says it
is not for girls, I make sure I go ahead and do it.ﬂ  Laxmi has had
to do this several times in her life Œ when she wanted to take electronics; when she rode
motorcycles at the polytechnic; and when she decided to become an engine driver.
Her philosophy is simple Œ ﬁAs long as I am having fun without harming anyone, as long as I am
doing well and helping my parents,  why should I not lead a lifestyle of my choice?ﬂ

Fewer opportunities and rigid expectationsFewer opportunities and rigid expectationsFewer opportunities and rigid expectationsFewer opportunities and rigid expectationsFewer opportunities and rigid expectationsA lot of the children in Rosie Ma™am™s class drewwomen as nurses and men as army officers. Thereason they did this is because they feel that outsidethe home too, women are good at only certain jobs.For example, many people believe that women makebetter nurses because they are more patient andgentle. This is linked to women™s roles within thefamily. Similarly, it is believed that science requiresa technical mind and girls and women are not capableof dealing with technical things.Because so many people believe in thesestereotypesstereotypesstereotypesstereotypesstereotypes, many girls do not get the same supportthat boys do to study and train to become doctorsand engineers. In most families, once girls finishschool, they are encouraged by their families to seemarriage as their main aim in life.Chapter 5: Women Change the World Women Change the World Women Change the World Women Change the World Women Change the World
