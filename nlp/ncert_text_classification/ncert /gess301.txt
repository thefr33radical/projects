2UNITONE  3Equality in Indian DemocracyTeacher™s noteTeacher™s noteTeacher™s noteTeacher™s noteTeacher™s noteThis Unit introduces the learner to thecritical role of equality in democracy, withspecific reference to India. The Constitutionof India guarantees equality to all citizens.Despite this, the daily lives of people inIndia are far from equal.     Earlierdiscussions on equality in Civics textbooksmost often reiterated certain provisions ofthe Constitution without adequatelyconsidering the reality of these in people™slives. This Unit adopts a different approach.It discusses the need for equality throughhighlighting the inequalities that continueto be practised and experienced by variouscommunities.The first chapter introduces the learnerto Kanta, Omprakash Valmiki and the
Ansaris, all of whom experience inequalityin different ways. It is through theirexperiences that we introduce the conceptof dignity. The government™s role in passinglaws and instituting policies is discussedto show that commitment to the alleviationof existing inequalities is a major part ofthe work that governments undertake. Thechapter also briefly introduces an issue ofinequality in the United States of Americato highlight that this is a global phenomenonand a feature of many democratic countries.The second chapter of this Unit isChapter 10 of this book. It     ties togetherthe main ideas on equality raisedthroughout the text. A significant portionof the last chapter is devoted to discussingpeople™s contribution to the fight forequality. This is achieved through focusingon one social movement as well ashighlighting creative (writings, songs,poems) ways through which people expresstheir demands for equality.Both chapters aim to help the learnerunderstand that equality and democracyare dynamic and not static concepts. Thisdynamism is reflected in the government™spassing of new laws and programmes, andin people™s movements around varioussocial and economic issues.Kanta, Omprakash, the Ansaris, and theTawa Matsya Sangh all have diverse local
equivalents. Local situations should beused as a practical reference to make thediscussion on underlying concepts morerelevant and appropriate. A discussion onequality in the classroom requires empathyas well as a firm commitment on theteacher™s     part to ensuring that the dignity
of all learners be respected.3  On EqualityIndia is a democracy. In theClass VI book, we looked atthe key elements of ademocratic government.These include people™sparticipation, theresolution of conflict, andequality and justice.Equality is a key feature ofdemocracy and influencesall aspects of itsfunctioning. In this chapteryou will read more aboutequality Œ what it is, why itis important in ademocracy, and whether ornot everyone is equal inIndia. Let™s begin bylooking at Kanta™s story.Isn™t it good Suja that we can all vote as

Look again at the various peoplewho are standing in line with her. Kanta recognisesher employer, Ashok Jain and Chotte Lal, herneighbour. In a democratic country, like India, alladults irrespective of what religion they belong to,how much education they have had, what caste theyare, or whether they are rich or poor are allowed tovote. This, as you have already read in the Class VIbook, is called universal adult franchiseuniversal adult franchiseuniversal adult franchiseuniversal adult franchiseuniversal adult franchise and is anessential aspect of all democracies. The idea of
universal adult franchise is based on the idea ofequality because it states that every adult in acountry, irrespective of their wealth and thecommunities she/he belongs to, has one vote. Kantais excited to vote and happy that she is equal to allof the others because each of them has one vote.But as her day goes on, Kanta becomes less certainabout what this equality really means.What is it that makes Kanta unsure? Let™s take alook at a day in her life. She lives in a slum and hasa drain behind her house. Her daughter is sick butshe cannot take the day off from work because sheneeds to borrow money from her employers to takeher child to the doctor. Her job as a domestic helptires her out, and finally she ends her day by againstanding in a long line. This line, in front of thegovernment hospital, is unlike the one in the morningbecause most of the people standing in it are poor.Do you think Kanta hasenough reason to doubtwhether she really is equal?List three reasons from thestory above that mightmake her feel like this.Make sure to do the
corners properly.

habit of it!No Madam...That evening...

  Other kinds of equalityOther kinds of equalityOther kinds of equalityOther kinds of equalityOther kinds of equalityKanta is one of many people who live in democraticIndia and who have the right to vote but whose dailyliving and working conditions are far from equal.Apart from being poor, people in India experienceinequality in different ways. Let us see what thismeans by reading the two stories given below. Eachof these is based on real incidents in people™s livesand reflects the different kinds of inequalities thatexist in India.One of the more common forms of inequality inIndia is the caste system. If you live in rural India
your caste identity is something that you probablylearned or experienced very young. If you live inurban India some of you might think that people nolonger believe in caste. But just look at thesematrimonials shown from a leading Englishnewspaper and you will see how important the issueof caste continues to be in the minds of highlyeducated urban Indians.Now let us read a story about the experiences of aDalit child attending school. You have already readabout Dalits in the Class VI book. Dalit is a termthat the so-called lower castes use to addressthemselves. Dalit means ‚broken™ and by using thisword, lower castes are pointing to how they were,
and continue to be, seriously discriminated against.Omprakash Valmiki is a famous Dalit writer. Inhis autobiography, Joothan, he writes, ﬁI had to sitaway from the others in the class, and that too onthe floor. The mat ran out before reaching the spot Isat on. Sometimes I would have to sit way behindeverybody, right near the door–sometimes theywould beat me without any reason.ﬂ When he was inClass IV, the headmaster asked Omprakash to sweepthe school and the playground. He writes, ﬁTheplayground was way larger than my small physiquecould handle and in cleaning it, my back began toache. My face was covered with dust. Dust had goneCircle the reference to caste in thematrimonial advertisements givenabove.Chapter 1: On Equality On Equality On Equality On Equality On Equality7
