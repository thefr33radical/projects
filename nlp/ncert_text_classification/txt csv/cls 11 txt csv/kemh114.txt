There are few things which we know which are not capable ofmathematical reasoning and when these can not, it is a sign that ourknowledge of them is very small and confused and where a mathematicalreasoning can be had, it is as great a folly to make use of another,
as to grope for a thing in the dark when you have a candle stickstanding by you. Œ ARTHENBOT
 14.1  IntroductionIn this Chapter, we shall discuss about some basic ideas of
Mathematical Reasoning. All of us know that human beings

evolved from the lower species over many millennia. Themain asset that made humans ﬁsuperiorﬂ to other specieswas the ability to reason. How well this ability can be useddepends on each person™s power of reasoning. How to

develop this power? Here, we shall discuss the process of
reasoning especially in the context of mathematics.In mathematical language, there are two kinds ofreasoning Œ inductive and deductive. We have already
discussed the inductive reasoning in the context of
mathematical induction. In this Chapter, we shall discuss

some fundamentals of deductive reasoning.14.2  Statements
The basic unit involved in mathematical reasoning is a mathematical statement.Let us start with two sentences:In 2003, the president of India was a woman.
An elephant weighs more than a human being.
