(1805-1865)Mathematics is the Queen of Sciences and Arithmetic is the Queen of
Mathematics. Œ GAUSS 5.1  IntroductionIn earlier classes, we have studied linear equations in oneand two variables and quadratic equations in one variable.
We have seen that the equation 
x2 + 1 = 0 has no realsolution as x2 + 1 = 0 gives x2 = Œ 1 and square of everyreal number is non-negative. So, we need to extend the
real number system to a larger system so that we canfind the solution of the equation x2 = Œ 1. In fact, the mainobjective is to solve the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, whereD = b2 Œ  4ac < 0, which is not possible in the system ofreal numbers.5.2  Complex NumbersLet us denote 1 by the symbol i. Then, we have 21i. This means that i is asolution of the equation x2 + 1 = 0.A number of the form a + ib, where a and b are real numbers, is defined to be acomplex number. For example, 2 + 
i3,  (Œ 1) + 3i,  1411i are complex numbers.For the complex number z = a + ib, a is called the real part
, denoted by Re z andb is called the imaginary part denoted by Im z of the complex number z. For example,if z = 2 + i5, then Re z = 2 and Im z = 5.Two complex numbers 
z1 = a + ib and z2 = c + id are equal if  a = c and b = d.5

Example 1 If 4x + i(3x Œ y) = 3 + i (Œ 6), where x and y are real numbers, then findthe values of x and y.Solution We have
4x + i (3x Œ y) = 3 + i (Œ6)... (1)
Equating the real and the imaginary parts of (1), we get4x = 3, 3x Œ y = Œ 6,which, on solving simultaneously, give  
34x and 334y.5.3   Algebra of Complex Numbers
In this Section, we shall develop the algebra of complex numbers.5.3.1   Addition of two complex numbers
 Let z1 = a + ib and z2 = c + id be any twocomplex numbers. Then, the sum  z1 + z2 is defined as follows:z1 + z2 = (a + c) + i (b + d), which is again a complex number.
For example, (2 + i3) + (Œ 6 +i5) = (2 Œ 6) + i (3 + 5) = Œ 4 + i 8The addition of complex numbers satisfy the following properties:(i)The closure law
  The sum of two complex numbers is a complex
number, i.e., 
z1 + z2 is a complex number for all complex numbersz1 and z2.(ii)The commutative law  For any two complex numbers z1 and z2,z1 + z2 = z2 + z1(iii)The associative law  For any three complex numbers z1, z2, z3,(z1 + z2) + z3 = z1 + (z2 + z3).(iv)The existence of additive identity  There exists the complex number0 + i 0 (denoted as 0), called the additive identity or the zero complex
number,
 such that, for every complex number z, z + 0 = z.(v)The existence of additive inverse  To every complex number
z = a + ib, we have the complex number Œ a + i(Œ b) (denoted as Œ  z),called the additive inverse or negative of z. We observe that 
z + (Œz) = 0(the additive identity).5.3.2  Difference of two complex numbers Given any two complex numbers z1 andz2, the difference z1 Œ z2 is defined as follows:z1 Œ z2 = z1 + (Œ z2).For example,(6 + 3
i) Œ (2 Œ i) = (6 + 3i) + (Œ 2 + i ) = 4 + 4iand(2 Œ  
i) Œ (6 + 3i) = (2 Œ i) + ( Œ 6 Œ 3i) = Œ 4 Œ 4i
COMPLEX NUMBERS AND QUADRATIC EQUATIONS       995.3.3  Multiplication of two complex numbers Let z1 = a + ib and z2 = c + id be anytwo complex numbers. Then, the product z1 z2 is defined as follows:z1 z2 = (ac Œ  bd) + i(ad + bc)For example, (3 + i5) (2 + i6) = (3 × 2 Œ 5 × 6) + i(3 × 6 + 5 × 2) = Œ 24 + i28The multiplication of complex numbers possesses the following properties, whichwe state without proofs.(i)The closure law 
The product of two complex numbers is a complex number,
the product z1 z2 is a complex number for all complex numbers z1 and z2.(ii)The commutative law For any two complex numbers z1 and z2,z1 z2 = z2 z1.(iii)The associative law For any three complex numbers z1, z2, z3,(z1 z2) z3 = z1 (z2 z3).(iv)The existence of multiplicative identity There exists the complex number1 + i 0 (denoted as 1),  called the multiplicative identity such that z.1 = z,for every complex number z.(v)The existence of multiplicative inverse For every non-zero complexnumber z = a + ib or a + bi(a  0, b  0), we have the complex number2222

In general, for any integer k, i4k = 1, i4k + 1 = i, i4k + 2 = Œ1, i4k + 3 = Œ i5.3.6  The square roots of a negative real numberNote that  i2 = Œ1 and  ( Œ i)2 = i2 = Œ 1Therefore,  the square roots of Œ 1 are i, Œ i. However, by the symbol 
1, we wouldmean i only.
Now, we can see that 
i and Œi both are the solutions of the equation x2 + 1 = 0 orx2 = Œ1.Similarly2233i i2 = 3 (Œ 1) = Œ 323i = 23 i2 = Œ 3Therefore,  the square roots of Œ3 are 3i and 3i.Again, the symbol 3 is meant to represent 3i only, i.e., 
3 = 3i.Generally, if 
a is a positive real number, 
a = 1a = ai,We already know that 
ab = ab for all positive real number a and b. Thisresult also holds true when either 
a > 0, b < 0  or a < 0,  b > 0. What if a < 0, b < 0?Let us examine.Note that

 (by assuming ab = ab for all real numbers)= 1 = 1,  which is a contradiction to the fact that 21i.Therefore, abab
 if both a and b are negative real numbers.Further, if any of 
a and b is zero, then, clearly,

z, denoted by | z |, is definedto be the  non-negative real number 22ab, i.e., | z | = 22ab and the conjugateof z, denoted as z, is the complex number a Œ  ib, i.e.,  z = a Œ  ib.For example,2233110

5.5  Argand Plane and Polar Representation
We already know that corresponding to
each ordered pair of real numbers(x, y), we get a unique point in the XY-
plane and vice-versa with reference to aset of mutually perpendicular lines knownas the x-axis and the y-axis. The complexnumber x + iy which  corresponds to theordered pair (x, y) can be representedgeometrically as the unique point P(x, y)in the XY-plane and vice-versa.
Some complex numbers such as2 + 4i, Œ 2 + 3i, 0 + 1i, 2 + 0i, Œ 5 Œ2i and1 Œ 2i which correspond to the orderedpairs (2, 4), ( Œ 2, 3), (0, 1), (2, 0), ( Œ5, Œ2), and (1, Œ 2), respectively, have been
represented geometrically by the points A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively in

the Fig 5.1.The plane having a complex number assigned to each of its point is called thecomplex plane or the Argand plane
.
COMPLEX NUMBERS AND QUADRATIC EQUATIONS       105Obviously, in the Argand plane, the modulus of the complex number
x + iy = 22xy is the distance between the point P(x, y) and the origin O (0, 0)(Fig 5.2). The points on the x-axis corresponds to the complex numbers of the forma + i 0 and the points on the y-axis corresponds to the complex numbers of the formFig 5.2Fig 5.30 + i b. The x-axis and y-axis in the Argand plane are called, respectively, the 
real axis
and the imaginary axis.The representation of a  complex number z = x + iy and its conjugatez = x Œ iy in the Argand plane are, respectively, the points P
 (x, y) and Q (x, Œ y).Geometrically, the point (
x, Œ y) is the mirror image of the point (x, y) on the realaxis (Fig 5.3).

5.5.1  Polar representation of a complexnumber Let the point P represent the non-zero complex number z = x + iy. Let thedirected line segment OP be of length r and be the angle which OP makes with thepositive direction of x-axis (Fig 5.4).We may note that the point P is
uniquely determined by the ordered pair ofreal numbers (r, ), called the polarcoordinates of the point 
P. We consider
the origin as the pole and the positivedirection of the x axis as the initial line.We have, 
x = r cos , y = r sin  and therefore, z = r (cos  + i sin ). The latter
is said to be the polar form of the complex number. Here 22rxyz

 is themodulus of z and  is called the argument (or amplitude) of z which is denoted by arg z.For any complex number z  0, there corresponds only one value of  in0  < 2. However, any other interval of length 2
, for example Œ <   , can besuch an interval.We shall take the value of 
 such that Œ  <    , called principalargument of z and is denoted by arg z, unless specified otherwise.  (Figs. 5.5 and 5.6)Fig 5.4Fig 5.5 02

of real numbers in the cases where discriminant is non-negative, i.e.,   0,
Let us consider the following quadratic equation:02cbxax with real coefficients a, b, c and a  0.Also, let us assume that the  b2 Œ 4ac < 0.Now, we know that we can find the square root of negative real numbers in the
set of complex numbers. Therefore, the solutions to the above equation are available inthe set of complex numbers which are given byx = 224422bbacbacbi

Note    At this point of time, some would be interested to know as to how many
roots does an equation have? In this regard, the following theorem known as theFundamental theorem of Algebra 
is stated below (without proof).ﬁA polynomial equation has at least one root.ﬂAs a consequence of this theorem, the following result, which is of immenseimportance, is arrived at:ﬁA polynomial equation of degree n has n roots.ﬂExample 9 Solve  x2 + 2 = 0Solution  We have,
