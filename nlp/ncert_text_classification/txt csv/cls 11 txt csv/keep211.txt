11.1 Overview
11.1.1 
Sections of a cone  Let l be a fixed vertical line and m be another line intersectingit at a fixed point V and inclined to it at an angle 
 (Fig. 11.1).
Fig. 11.1
Suppose we rotate the line m around the line l in such a way that the angle  remainsconstant.  Then the surface generated is a double-napped right circular hollow coneherein after referred as cone and extending indefinitely in both directions (Fig. 11.2).Fig. 11.2Fig. 11.3
Chapter11CONIC SECTIONS
The point V is called the vertex; the line l is the axis of the cone. The rotating line m iscalleda 
generator of the cone.  The vertex separates the cone into two parts callednappes.If we take the intersection of a plane with a cone, the section so obtained is called aconic section. Thus, conic sections are the curves obtained by intersecting a rightcircular cone by a plane.We obtain different kinds of conic sections depending on the position of the intersecting
plane with respect to the cone and the angle made by it with the vertical axis of the
cone. Let  be the angle made by the intersecting plane with the vertical axis of thecone (Fig.11.3).The intersection of the plane with the cone can take place either at the vertex of thecone or at any other part of the nappe either below or above the vertex.When the plane cuts the nappe (other than the vertex) of the cone, we have thefollowing situations:(a)When 
 = 90o,  the section is a circle
.(b)When 
 <  <  90o, the section is an ellipse.(c)When 
 = ; the section is a parabola.(In each of the above three situations, the plane cuts entirely across one nappeof the cone).(d)When 0 
  < ; the plane cuts through both the nappes and the curves ofintersection is a hyperbola.Indeed these curves are important tools for present day exploration of outer space andalso for research into the behaviour of atomic particles.We take conic sections as plane curves. For this purpose, it is convenient to use equivalent
definition that refer only to the plane in which the curve lies, and refer to special pointsand lines in this plane called foci and directrices. According to this approach, parabola,
ellipse and hyperbola are defined in terms of a fixed point (called focus) and fixed line
(called directrix) in the plane.If S is the focus and l is the directrix, then the set of all points in the plane whosedistance from S bears a constant ratio e called eccentricity to their distance from l is aconic section.
As special case of ellipse, we obtain circle for which e = 0 and hence we study itdifferently.
11.1.2  
Circle  A circle is the set of all points in a plane which are at a fixed distance
from a fixed point in the plane. The fixed point is called the centre of the circle and thedistance from centre to any point on the circle is called the radius of the circle.CONIC SECTIONS    187

The equation of a circle with radius r havingcentre (h, k) is given by (x Œ h)2 + (y Œ k)2 = r2The general equation of the circle is given byx2 + y2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0, where g, f and c areconstants.(a)The centre of this circle is (Œ 
g, Œ f)(b)The radius of the circle is 
22gfcThe general equation of the circle passing through
the origin is given by x2 + y2 + 2gx + 2fy = 0.General equation of second degree i.e., ax2 + 2hxy + by2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0 representa circle if (i) the coefficient of x2 equals the coefficient of y2, i.e., a = b  0 and (ii) thecoefficient of xy is zero, i.e., h = 0.The parametric equations of the circle x2 + y2 = r2 are given by x = r cos, y = r sinwhere  is the parameter and the parametric equations of the circle (x Œ h)2 + (y Œ k)2 = r2are given byx Œ h =r cos, y Œ k = r sinorx =h + r cos, y = k + r sin.Fig. 11.5
Note:The general equation of the circle involves threeconstants which implies that at least three conditions are
required to determine a circle uniquely.
11.1.3  
ParabolaA parabola is the set of points P whose distances from a
fixed point F in the plane are equal to their distances froma fixed line l in the plane. The fixed point F is called focusand the fixed line l the directrix of the parabola.Fig. 11.6

CONIC SECTIONS    189Standard equations of parabola
The four possible forms of parabola are shown below in Fig. 11.7 (a) to (d)

The latus rectum of a parabola is a line segment perpendicular to the axis of the
parabola, through the focus and whose end points lie on the parabola (Fig. 11.7).Fig. 11.7

Ellipse  An ellipse is the set of points in a plane, the sum of whose distancesfrom two fixed points is constant. Alternatively, an ellipse is the set of all points in the
plane whose distances from a fixed point in the plane bears a constant ratio, less than,
to their distance from a fixed line in the plane. The fixed point is called focus, the fixed
line a directrix and the constant ratio (e) the centricity of the ellipse.We have two standard forms of the ellipse, i.e.,

Hyperbola  A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane, the difference of
whose distances from two fixed points is constant. Alternatively, a hyperbola is the set

of all points in a plane whose distances from a fixed point in the plane bears a constantratio, greater than 1, to their distances from a fixed line in the plane. The fixed point iscalled a focus, the fixed line a directrix and the constant ratio denoted by e, the ecentricityof the hyperbola.We have two standard forms of the hyperbola, i.e.,

Example 1  Find the centre and radius of the circle x2 + y2 Œ 2x + 4y = 8Solution we write the given equation in the form (x2 Œ 2x) + (
y2 + 4y) = 8Now, completing the squares, we get
(x2 Œ 2x + 1) + (
y2 + 4y + 4) = 8 + 1 + 4(x Œ 1)2 + (y + 2)2 = 13Comparing it with the standard form of the equation of the circle, we see that thecentre of the circle is (1, Œ2) and radius is 13.Example 2  If the equation of the parabola is x2 = Œ 8y, find coordinates of the focus,the equation of the directrix and length of latus rectum.Solution The given equation is of the form x2 = Œ 4ay where a is positive.Therefore, the focus is on y-axis in the negative direction and parabola opens downwards.
194    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS Œ MATHEMATICSComparing the given equation with standard form, we get a = 2.Therefore, the coordinates of the focus are (0, Œ2) and the the equation of directrix isy = 2 and the length of the latus rectum is 4a, i.e., 8.Example 3 Given the ellipse with equation 9x2 + 25y2 = 225, find the major and minoraxes, eccentricity, foci and vertices.Solution We put the equation in standard form by dividing by 225 and get
22259
xy =1This shows that a = 5 and b = 3. Hence 9 = 25(1 Œ e2), so e = 45. Since the denominatorof x2 is larger, the major axis is along x-axis, minor axis along y-axis, foci are (4, 0) and(Œ 4, 0) and vertices are (5, 0) and (Œ5, 0).Example 4  Find the equation of the ellipse with foci at ( 5, 0) and x = 365 as one ofthe directrices.Solution We have 
ae = 5, 365a
e which give a2 = 36 or a = 6. Therefore, 
e = 5
6.Now b = 22516111
36ae
. Thus, the equation of the ellipse is 2213611
xy.Example 5 For the hyperbola 9x2 Œ 16y2 = 144, find the vertices, foci and eccentricity.
Solution The equation of the hyperbola can be written as 22Œ1169
xy, so a = 4, b = 3and 9 = 16 (e2 Œ 1), so that  e2 = 925
11616
, which gives e = 54. Vertices are (± 
a, 0) =(± 4, 0) and foci are (± ae, 0) = (± 5, 0).
Example 6  Find the equation of the hyperbola with vertices at (0, ± 6) and e = 53.Find its foci.Solution Since the vertices are on the y-axes (with origin at the mid-point), the equationis of the form 2221yxab.
CONIC SECTIONS    195As vertices are (0, ± 6), a = 6, b2 = a2 (e2 Œ 1) = 36 25164

yx and the foci are (0, ± ae) = (0, ± 10).Long Answer Type
Example 7  Find the equation of the circle which passes through the points (20, 3),(19, 8) and (2, Œ9). Find its centre and radius.Solution By substitution of coordinates in the general equation of the  circle given byx2 + y2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0, we have40g + 6f + c =Œ 409
38g + 16 f + c =Œ 425
4g Œ 18 f + c =Œ 85
From these three equations, we getg = Œ 7, f = Œ 3 and c = Œ111
Hence, the equation of the circle isx2 + y2 Œ 14x Œ 6y Œ 111 =0
or(
x Œ 7)2 + (y Œ 3)2 =13
2Therefore, the centre of the circle is (7, 3) and radius is 13.Example 8  An equilateral triangle is inscribed in the parabola y2 = 4ax whose onevertex is at the vertex of the parabola. Find the length of the side of the triangle.Solution As shown in the figure APQ denotes the equilateral triangle with its equalsides of length l (say).HereAP =
l so AR = 
l cos30°=32lAlso,PR =
l sin 30° = 2l.Thus 3,22ll are the coordinates of the point P lying on theparabola y2 = 4ax.Fig. 11.10

196    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS Œ MATHEMATICSTherefore,24l =4a 32l  l = 8 a3.Thus, 8 3a is the required length of the side of the equilateral triangle inscribed inthe parabola y2 = 4

b2 + a2 =a2 b2or9
a2 (a2 Œ e2) + a2 =a2 a2 (1 Œ e2)(Using 
b2 = a2 (1 Œ e2)ora2 =323Againb2 =a2 (1 Œ e2) = 323 232
155Hence, the required equation of the ellipse is223232
35xy =1or3
x2 + 5y2 =32.
Example 10  Find the equation of the hyperbola whose vertices are (± 6, 0) and one ofthe directrices is x = 4.Solution  As the vertices are on the 
x-axis and their middle point is the origin, theequation is of the type          22221xyab.Here b2 = a2 (e2 Œ 1), vertices are (± a, 0) and directrices are given by x = ± a
e.
CONIC SECTIONS    197Thus  a = 6, ae = 4 and so 3

required equation of the hyperbola is 2213645

 The equation of the circle in the first quadrant touching each coordinateaxis at a distance of one unit from the origin is:(A)x2 + y2 Œ 2x Œ 2y + 1= 0(B)
x2 + y2 Œ 2x Œ 2y Œ 1 = 0(C)x2 + y2  Œ 2x Œ 2y = 0(C)
x2 + y2 Œ 2x + 2y Œ 1 = 0Solution The correct choice is (A), since the equation can be written as (
x Œ 1)2 +(y Œ 1)2 = 1 which represents a circle touching both the axes with its centre (1, 1) and
radius one unit.Example 12  The equation of the circle having centre (1, Œ2) and passing through thepoint of intersection of the lines 3x + y = 14 and 2x + 5y = 18 is(A)x2 + y2 Œ 2x + 4y Œ 20 = 0(B)
x2 + y2 Œ 2x Œ 4y Œ 20 = 0(C)x2 + y2 + 2x Œ 4y Œ 20 = 0(D)
x2 + y2 + 2x + 4y Œ 20 = 0Solution The correct option is (A). The point of intersection of 3x + y Œ 14 = 0 and 2x+ 5y Œ 18 = 0 are x = 4, y = 2, i.e., the point (4, 2)Therefore, the radius is = 9165

x ± y = 0Solution  (B) is the correct choice. Let P and Q bepoints on the parabola y2 = 6x and OP, OQ be the lines
joining the vertex O to the points P and Q whoseabscissa are 24.Thusy2 =6 × 24 = 144
