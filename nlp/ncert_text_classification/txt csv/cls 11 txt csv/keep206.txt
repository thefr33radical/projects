6.1 Overview6.1.1 A statement involving the symbols ‚>™, ‚<™, ‚ 
™, ‚™ is called an inequality. For
example 5 > 3, x  4, x + y 9.(i)Inequalities which do not involve variables are called numerical inequalities. For
example 3 < 8, 5  2.(ii)Inequalities which involve variables are called literal inequalities. For example,x > 3, y  5, x Œ y  0.(iii)An 
inequality may contain more than one variable and it can be linear, quadratic or
cubic etc. For eaxmple, 3
x Œ 2 < 0 is a linear inequality in one variable, 2x + 3y  4is a linear inequality in two variables and x2 + 3x + 2 < 0 is a quadratic inequalityin one variable.(iv)Inequalities involving the symbol ‚>™ or ‚<™ are called strict inequalities. Forexample, 3x Œ y > 5, x < 3.(v)Inequalities involving the symbol ‚
™ or ‚™ are called slack inequalities. Forexample, 3x Œ y  5, x  5.6.1.2  Solution of an inequality(i)The value(s) of the variable(s) which makes the inequality a true statement is
called its solutions. The set of all solutions of an inequality is called the solutionset of the inequality. For example, 
x Œ 1  0, has infinite number of solutions asall real values greater than or equal to one make it a true statement. The inequalityx2 + 1 < 0 has no solution in R as no real value of x makes it a true statement.To solve an inequality we can
(i)Add (or subtract) the same quantity to (from) both sides without changing the
sign of inequality.
(ii)Multiply (or divide) both sides by the same positive quantity without changing thesign of inequality. However, if both 
sides of inequality are multiplied (or divided)by the same negative quantity the sign of inequality is reversed, i.e., ‚>™ changesinto ‚<™ and vice versa.Chapter6LINEAR INEQUALITIES
6.1.3 Representation of solution of linear inequality in one variable on anumber lineTo represent the solution of a linear inequality in one variable on a number line, we use
the following conventions:(i)If the inequality involves ‚
™ or ‚™, we draw filled circle (Ł) on the number lineto indicate that the number corresponding to the filled circle is included in the
solution set.(ii)If 
the inequality involves ‚>™ or ‚<™, we draw an open circle (O) on the numberline to indicate that the number corresponding to the open circle is excluded fromthe solution set.6.1.4  Graphical representation of the solution of a linear inequality(a)To represent the solution of a linear inequality in one or two variables graphically
in a plane, we proceed as follows:(i)If the inequality involves ‚
™ or ‚™, we draw the graph of the line as a thickline to indicate that the points on this line are included in the solution set.(ii)If 
the inequality involves ‚>™ or ‚<™, we draw the graph of the line as dottedline to indicate that the points on the line are excluded from the solution set.(b)Solution of a linear inequality in one variable can be represented on number line
as well as in the plane but the solution of a linear inequality in two variables of thetype ax + by > c, ax + by  c, ax + by < c or ax + by  c (a  0, b  0) can berepresented in the plane only.(c)Two or more inequalities taken together comprise a system of inequalities and
the solutions of the system of inequalities are the solutions common to all theinequalities comprising the system.6.1.5  Two important results
(a)If 
a, b  R and b  0, then(i)ab > 0 or  ab >  0 a and b are of the same sign.(ii)ab < 0 or  ab <  0 a and b are of opposite sign.(b)If 
a is any positive real number, i.e., a > 0, then(i)|x| < a  Œ a < x < a|x|  a  Œ a  x  a(ii)|x| > a      x <  Œ a  or  x  >
