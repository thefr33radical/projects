156BIOLOGY, EXEMPLAR PROBLEMSCHAPTER 25MODEL QUESTION PAPERThe chapter deals with the design of Model Question Paper for Biology Class XI. This is based  onmodel question paper for Biology Class XII placed on NCERT web site (www.ncert.nic.in) and also
keeping in view the question paper developed by  CBSE for their board examination 2007. Very
Short Answer (VSA) type questions of two marks are included in the present design and MultipleChoice Question (MCQ) of one mark each is also suggested. This chapter is divided into three
headings, such as Design of the Question Paper, Model Questions and Answers with Marking Scheme.
DESIGN OF THE QUESTION PAPERIn order to develop a balanced question paper various parameters are taken into consideration.They are the type of questions, marks allocation, number of questions, time allocation, unit/
chapterwise distribution, difficulty level etc. An attempt has been made to provide proper weightageto these parameters under four separate sub-headings.Type of Question and Marking1.Multiple Choice Question

megaspores and microspores that give rise respectively tomegagametophytes and microgametophytes, a condition required forseed production. Production of seed is an extreme form of heterospory,in which ovule is formed, the structure which develops into seed. Theseed has replaced the spore of lower plants as the unit of dispersal. The
presence of heterospory in pteridophytes indicates the evolution ofgymnosperms from pteridophytes.26.aŠTelophase

synthesis, is also a constituent of several coenzymes, vitamins andferrodoxin which are involved in some biochemical pathway. It is presentin amino acid cystein.28.The phenomenon by which the terminal apical bud suppresses the
growth of lateral buds is referred to as apical dominance. This is because
of the hormone auxin synthesised in the apical bud that inhibits lateralbud development.This can be overcome by removing the apical bud (decapitating) andyoung leaves which will increase branching. It may also be possible to
overcome this phenomena by application of cytokinin and antiauxinslike ethylene chlorohydrin, DCA (dichloroanisole) etc.29.The structures that get entangled in the teeth while eating fruits like
peach and pear are actually the stone cells or brachysclereids which areunbranched, short and isodiametric type of sclereids. These stone cells
usually occur in groups and provide grit or stone like hardness that getentangled in the spaces between teeth.30.Succulents (water storing) plants fix CO

the ovary of the flower. Their number, structure, position in
the ovary varies in different plants. They also differ in their
mode of attachment with the the ovary wall. At the point ofattachement there is a cellular ridge or cushion of cells calledplacenta. The mode of attachment of ovule to the placenta isknown as placentation which is of the following types:(a) Parietal (b) Marginal (c) Axile (d) Free Central (e) Basal(b)(c)(d)Axile        Parietal

electrons (and 8H+) are accepted by N2, 2 NH3 are releasedfrom the enzyme. The biochemical pathway can besummarized by the reaction below:N2 + 8eŒ + 8H+ + 16 ATP  2 NH3 + 12ADP + 12 Pi(ii) The end product of this reaction is ammonia.(iii)At ph
ysiological pH, the ammonia is protonated toform NH4+ (ammonium) ion which is used to synthesizeamino acids in plants. The synthesis of amino acids takeplace by two main ways viz. Reductive amination andtransamination.oraŠIt is actively mobilizedbŠHighly mobile- Nitrogen, magnesium

cŠSymptoms of deficiency of mobile elements are morepronounced in older leaves and symptoms of deficiency ofrelatively immobile element appear first in younger leaves.This information can be utilised by horticulturist and
agriculturist to get a broad idea of the deficiency elementsin plants.34.Muscle contraction is initiated by a neural signal, which after
reaching neuromuscular junction or motor end platereleases  a neurotransmitter, which generates an action

potential in the sarcolemma. Action potential spreadsthrough muscle fibre and causes the release of calcium ionsinto the sarcoplasm. Increase in Ca2+ level leads to thebinding of calcium with a subunit of troponin on actinfilaments and thereby removes the masking of active sites
for myosin. Utilising the energy from ATP hydrolysis, themyosin head now binds to the exposed active site on actinto form a cross-bridge. This pulls the attached actin filamentstowards the centre of ‚A™ band. The ‚Z™ line attached to theseactins are also pulled inwards thereby causing shortening
of the sarcomere, i.e., contraction.A new ATP binds to myosin head and the cross-bridge isbroken. The  ATP is again hydrolysed by the myosin headand the cycle of cross-bridge formation and breakage is½1½1223½+1½
