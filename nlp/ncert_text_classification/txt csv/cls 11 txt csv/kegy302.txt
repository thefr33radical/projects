17Map ScaleChapter 2Map ScaleYou have read in Chapter 1 that the scale is an essential element of
all types of maps. It is so important that if a network of lines andpolygons does not carry a scale, we call it a ﬁsketchﬂ.  Why is thescale so important ? What does it mean ? What are the different
methods of showing the scale on a map?  How useful is the scale inmeasuring the distances and the area? These are some of the
questions which will be taken up in the present chapter.
What is Scale ?You must have seen maps with a scale bar indicating equal divisions,
each marked with readings in kilometres or miles. These divisions
are used to find out the ground distance on the map.  In other
words, a map scale provides the relationship between the map and
the whole or a part of the earth™s surface shown on it.  We can also
express this relationship as a ratio of distances between two points

on the map and the corresponding distance between the same two
points on the ground.
Denominator: The number below the line in a fraction. For example, in a fractionof 1 : 50,000,  50,000 is the denominator.
Numerator: The number above the line in a fraction. For example, in a fraction of1 : 50,000,  1 is the numerator.
Representative Fraction: A method of scale of a map or plan expressed as afraction showing the ratio between a unit distance on the map or plan, and thedistance measured in the same units on the ground.
