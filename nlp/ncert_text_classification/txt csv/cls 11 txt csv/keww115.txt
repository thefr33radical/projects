The World is too Much With Us
117The World is too
Much With UsWilliam Wordsworth
The World is too much with us; late and soon,
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:
Little we see in Nature that is ours;We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
The Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;The Winds that will be howling at all hours,And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers,For this, for everything, we are out of tune;It moves us not.ŠGreat God! I™d rather beA Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.
5Pagan: a person whose religious beliefs do not belong to any of the main religionsof the world.Proteus: a character in Greek mythology who had the gift of prophecy but who,when questioned, would assume different shapes to elude their grasp.Triton:
 a sea-deity in Greek mythology, who is generally represented as blowing
a shell, his body above the waist being that of a man, below it of a dolphin.`

English Romantic Movement.He selected subjects from nature and rustic life. He heldthe view that the language of poetry should be simple and
natural.UNDERSTANDING THE POEM1.Why does the poet prefer to be a primitive Pagan rather than a
