(A) Main Concepts and Results≈ÅTrigonometric Ratios of the angle A in a triangle ABC right angled at B
are defined as:
sine of  A = sin A = 
sideoppositetoABC
hypotenuseAC
  cosine of  
A = cos  A = 
sideadjacenttoAAB
hypotenuseAC
tangent of  
A = tan  A = 
sideoppositetoABC
sideadjacenttoangleAAB
cosecant of  
A = cosec  A = 
1AC
sinABC
secant of  A = sec A 
1AC
 cosAAB
cotangent of  A = cot  A = 
1AB
tan ABC
 tan A = 
sinA
cosA
, cot A = 
cosA
sinA
